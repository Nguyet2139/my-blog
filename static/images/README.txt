Place your site images in this folder.

Expected filenames used by the site code (you can replace with your own, but then update the code paths accordingly):

- avatar.jpg                                (About page avatar)
- gallery1.jpg, gallery2.jpg, gallery3.jpg  (About page gallery)
- about-intro.gif                           (About page banner GIF)
- posts-banner.gif                          (Posts page banner GIF)
- cert1.jpg, cert2.jpg, cert3.jpg           (Certificates section images)
- anim1.gif, anim2.gif, anim3.gif, anim4.gif (Homepage decorative animations)

Notes:
- Keep images reasonably optimized for web.
- If you change filenames, search in the codebase for the old names and update the paths.
- Recommended minimum sizes: avatar 600x600+, gallery 1200px wide, GIFs as small as possible.
